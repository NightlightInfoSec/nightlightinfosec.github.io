<p>At the end of each year, like I'm sure most do, I reflect on the things that I have accomplished. It's great to remember all of the good things, but more often than not I find myself thinking about all of the things I didn't do. Things I said I was going to do, but didn't, or the things I did instead of the things I should have been doing. I have always identified with the above passage, because it rings true in my life. I tell myself that I'm going to buckle down and study, but instead I distract myself with Twitter, YouTube, or a myriad of other things. I tell myself I'm going to lose weight, but instead eat more donuts and m&amp;m's than I should.</p>
<p>We can't do this on our own in any way. In fact, the Christian faith revolves around the fact that because we can't do anything to save ourselves, God sent Jesus Christ to die on a cross and be raised again to save us. You might not share the same belief as me, but I'm sure you have had some of the same feelings of Regret, Shame, Depression, Anger&hellip;</p>
<p>Let's start a new chapter in 2020! Let's help each other out! Get out a piece of paper or open a word processor and write down 4 things you want to accomplish this year. It can be hard or it can be easy, you're going to do this not me.</p>
<h2 id="mine-are">Mine are:</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Study for AWS Certified Solutions Architect- Associate</strong>
Why: Because I need to get a leg up on this cloud thing
When: March is when the certification updates so let's get it beforehand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lose Weight</strong>
How Much: 40 lbs
Why: To be healthy for myself and my family</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Write</strong>
Why: Writing will help me to easily convey my thoughts
How Often: At least once a month</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Self-Control</strong>
Why: Because I don't have much of it
How: Ask for someone to help me stay accountable</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="heading"></h2>
<p>Also, write down <strong>WHY</strong> or <strong>HOW</strong> you're going to accomplish this. Next, find someone to help keep you accountable. If you don't have anyone, tweet them to me <a href="https://twitter.com/Jon_WithoutAn_H">@Jon_WithoutAn_H</a> and I'll try to check in every once and awhile. If you destroy those four tasks, make a new list and knock those out too! Let's make 2020 OUR year!</p>
