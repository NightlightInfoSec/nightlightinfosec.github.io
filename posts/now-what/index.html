<h2 id="a-cautionary-tale">A Cautionary Tale</h2>
<p>Writing a blog post is such a great way to solidify your thoughts.<br>
When you write, you really have to think about what you are saying.</p>
<p>When you buy a domain name though, sometimes you are living in the moment and forget about being logical.</p>
<h2 id="planning">Planning</h2>
<p>After I bought my domain name, I wanted to jump right in and start learning the ins and outs of creating a website.<br>
I was so caught up in the moment that I overlooked one of the most important steps: Planning.
If you are reading this, congratulations you just bought a domain name or are thinking of buying one. Hindsight is 20/20, and if I could
go back and start over I probably would. But I don't own a time machine, so we can all learn from my mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>Choosing the right format</strong> - What are you trying to achieve and what features do you want (be specific) ?</p>
<p>I chose to go with a blog because I believe that writing will help me think through and understand hard problems. To be honest, I also wanted a way to showcase my skills to any future employers too.</p>
<p>I wish I would have spent more time thinking about some of the smaller details of what future me would have wanted.<br>
Like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How are people going to comment on posts to keep me in check if I say something wrong?</li>
<li>How can someone search my blog for specific topics?</li>
<li>Is there a way to archive posts?</li>
<li>What other integrations are available?</li>
</ul>
<p>I can still figure some of this out later and implement changes, but if I would have already thought about this in the beginning I could have maybe saved myself some headaches.</p>
<h2 id="hosting">Hosting</h2>
<p>You have a lot to think about when it comes to hosting<br>
Like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much money do I want to spend?</li>
<li>Is uptime important to my site?</li>
<li>What kind of support do I need?</li>
<li>Does the hosting provider offer site templates?</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn't want to spend <strong><em>any</em></strong>  money on hosting, and thus forgot about anything else that a hosting provider might bring to the table. I instead decided to go with GitHub Pages, because it's <strong><em>free</em></strong> and I have used GitHub for other projects in the past.</p>
<h3 id="hosting-with-github-pages">Hosting with GitHub Pages</h3>
<p>First you will need to set up a GitHub account by following <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account">these Instructions</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Next create a new project/repository</em></strong></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/NightlightInfoSec/NightlightInfoSec.github.io/blob/master/img/NewProject.PNG?raw=true" alt="New Prject"><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong><em>Name the repository <code>UserName.github.io</code></em></strong></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/NightlightInfoSec/NightlightInfoSec.github.io/blob/master/img/Github_io.PNG?raw=true" alt="New Repo"><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong><em>This is where you would start using git to upload content to your new repository.
But maybe you're like me and are brand new to using version control. Fortunately, GitHub offers a git client called <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a> that works great</em></strong></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/NightlightInfoSec/NightlightInfoSec.github.io/blob/master/img/Download_GitHub_Desktop.PNG?raw=true" alt="GitHub Desktop"><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong><em>Sign into the Desktop Client</em></strong></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/NightlightInfoSec/NightlightInfoSec.github.io/blob/master/img/Signin_Git.PNG?raw=true" alt="Sign In"><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong><em>Go back to your GitHub repository and click &ldquo;Set up in Desktop&rdquo;(I created a new project for images since my page already exists)</em></strong></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/NightlightInfoSec/NightlightInfoSec.github.io/blob/master/img/Setup_Desktop.PNG?raw=true" alt="Setup Desktop"><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong><em>Click &ldquo;Open GitHubDesktop&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/NightlightInfoSec/NightlightInfoSec.github.io/blob/master/img/open_desktop.PNG?raw=true" alt="Open GitHub Destop"><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong><em>Select the local path you would like to host your files locally and click &ldquo;Clone&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/NightlightInfoSec/NightlightInfoSec.github.io/blob/master/img/Clone.PNG?raw=true" alt="Clone"><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong><em>Go back to your GitHub repository and Select &ldquo;Settings&rdquo;</em></strong></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/NightlightInfoSec/NightlightInfoSec.github.io/blob/master/img/Settings.PNG?raw=true" alt="Settings"><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong><em>Scroll down to &ldquo;GitHub Pages&rdquo; and select Source: Master Branch</em></strong></p>
<p><img src="https://github.com/NightlightInfoSec/NightlightInfoSec.github.io/blob/master/img/Pages.PNG?raw=true" alt="Pages"><br>
<br>
Here you also have the option to select a theme. These themes are rather limiting though, so I opted for a theme with a little more substance.</p>
<h2 id="design-and-implementation">Design and Implementation</h2>
<p>GitHub Pages hosts static web pages, so if you want something a little more fancier, you will need to choose a different hosting provider.</p>
<p>There are quite a few platforms for generating static web pages.</p>
<p>The most popular platform is probably <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. However, it requires installing the Ruby programming language which I don't have that much interest in learning (Choose what interests you). To be fair, they do have a lot of resources and themes that are useful to newcomers.</p>
<p>Instead I chose <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> because it's written in a language I'm intersted in learning, GO! They also have some pretty good resources and themes.</p>
<p>I wont go through installing <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> or <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">Hugo</a>, but I will go over some of the things I thought were not documented well.</p>
<p><strong>PS: Please do not confuse the face that I didn't want to install Ruby over GO becasue you have to learn those languages. That is just the language they are written in.</strong></p>
<h4 id="tip-number-1">Tip Number 1</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Unless specified in your theme's templates, all Posts are in draft form. Change this to false if you're planning to post immediately.</p>
<pre><code>  ---
  title: &quot;First Post&quot;
  date: 2019-10-31T14:28:26-05:00`
  draft: true
  ---
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tip-number-2">Tip Number 2</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You only need to upload the contents of the <code>/Public</code> folder to GitHub</p>
<pre><code>  /Public  is created once you run the Hugo command
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="tip-number-3">Tip Number 3</h4>
<ul>
<li>Most themes come with an <code>exampleSite</code> folder.  Use the <code>config.toml</code> file as a guide to configure your own.</li>
</ul>
<p>Push your files up to your GitHub Master repository and head over to <code>UserName.github.io</code></p>
<p>Your page should be live now on GitHub!!</p>
<h2 id="domain-name-system-dns">Domain Name System (DNS)</h2>
<p>DNS translates your new domain name into an IP address that your web browser understands.
Your hosting provider might be able to host your DNS for you for a fee.</p>
<p>For my DNS hosting, I went with <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> because they offer a free plan.</p>
<p>I changed the <code>CNAME</code> to Name=<code>NewDomainName</code> Content=<code>UserName.github.io</code></p>
<p>Back over on GitHub, in &ldquo;settings&rdquo; &ndash;&gt; &ldquo;GitHub Pages&rdquo; I added my domain name to the &ldquo;Custom Domain&rdquo; field and clicked &ldquo;Save&rdquo;</p>
<p>This adds a new file to your GitHub repository called <code>CNAME</code></p>
<h4 id="the-key-now-patience-because-it-can-take-a-while-for-this-information-to-propagate">The key now patience because it can take a while for this information to propagate.</h4>
<p>Hopefully by now everything is working and you are now able to enter your domain name into the address bar and be redirected to your GitHub Page!</p>
<p>I'm still learning, but I hope you found some value in this post!</p>
