<h1 id="i-just-bought-a-domain-now-what">I Just Bought A Domain: Now What</h1>

<h2 id="a-cautionary-tale">A Cautionary Tale</h2>

<p>Writing a blog post is such a great way to solidify your thoughts.<br />
When you write, you really have to think about what you are saying.</p>

<p>When you buy a domain name though, sometimes you are living in the moment and forget about being logical.</p>

<h2 id="planning">Planning</h2>

<p>After I bought my domain name, I wanted to jump right in and start learning the ins and outs of creating a website.<br />
I was so caught up in the moment that I overlooked one of the most important steps: Planning.
If you are reading this, congratulations you just bought a domain name or are thinking of buying one. Hindsight is <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub>, and if I could
go back and start over I probably would. But I don&rsquo;t own a time machine, so we can all learn from my mistakes.</p>

<p><strong>Choosing the right format</strong> - What are you trying to achieve and what features do you want (be specific) ?</p>

<p>I chose to go with a blog because I believe that writing will help me think through and understand hard problems. To be honest, I also wanted a way to showcase my skills to any future employers too.</p>

<p>I wish I would have spent more time thinking about some of the smaller details of what future me would have wanted.<br />
Like:</p>

<ul>
<li>How are people going to comment on posts to keep me in check if I say something wrong?</li>
<li>How can someone search my blog for specific topics?</li>
<li>Is there a way to archive posts?</li>
<li>What other integrations are available?</li>
</ul>

<p>I can still figure some of this out later and implement changes, but if I would have already thought about this in the beginning I could have maybe saved myself some headaches.</p>

<h2 id="hosting">Hosting</h2>

<p>You have a lot to think about when it comes to hosting<br />
Like:</p>

<ul>
<li>How much money do I want to spend?</li>
<li>Is uptime important to my site?</li>
<li>What kind of support do I need?</li>
<li>Does the hosting provider offer site templates?</li>
</ul>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t want to spend <strong><em>any</em></strong>  money on hosting, and thus forgot about anything else that a hosting provider might bring to the table. I instead decided to go with GitHub Pages, because it&rsquo;s <strong><em>free</em></strong> and I have used GitHub for other projects in the past.</p>

<h3 id="hosting-with-github-pages">Hosting with GitHub Pages</h3>

<p>First you will need to set up a GitHub account by following <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account">these Instructions</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Next create a new project/repository</em></strong></p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/NightlightInfoSec/NightlightInfoSec.github.io/blob/master/img/NewProject.PNG?raw=true" alt="New Prject" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><em>Name the repository <code>UserName.github.io</code></em></strong></p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/NightlightInfoSec/NightlightInfoSec.github.io/blob/master/img/Github_io.PNG?raw=true" alt="New Repo" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><em>This is where you would start using git to upload content to your new repository.
But maybe you&rsquo;re like me and are brand new to using version control. Fortunately, GitHub offers a git client called <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a> that works great</em></strong></p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/NightlightInfoSec/NightlightInfoSec.github.io/blob/master/img/Download_GitHub_Desktop.PNG?raw=true" alt="GitHub Desktop" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><em>Sign into the Desktop Client</em></strong></p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/NightlightInfoSec/NightlightInfoSec.github.io/blob/master/img/Signin_Git.PNG?raw=true" alt="Sign In" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><em>Go back to your GitHub repository and click &ldquo;Set up in Desktop&rdquo;(I created a new project for images since my page already exists)</em></strong></p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/NightlightInfoSec/NightlightInfoSec.github.io/blob/master/img/Setup_Desktop.PNG?raw=true" alt="Setup Desktop" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><em>Click &ldquo;Open GitHubDesktop&rdquo;</em></strong></p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/NightlightInfoSec/NightlightInfoSec.github.io/blob/master/img/open_desktop.PNG?raw=true" alt="Open GitHub Destop" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><em>Select the local path you would like to host your files locally and click &ldquo;Clone&rdquo;</em></strong></p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/NightlightInfoSec/NightlightInfoSec.github.io/blob/master/img/Clone.PNG?raw=true" alt="Clone" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><em>Go back to your GitHub repository and Select &ldquo;Settings&rdquo;</em></strong></p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/NightlightInfoSec/NightlightInfoSec.github.io/blob/master/img/Settings.PNG?raw=true" alt="Settings" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><em>Scroll down to &ldquo;GitHub Pages&rdquo; and select Source: Master Branch</em></strong></p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/NightlightInfoSec/NightlightInfoSec.github.io/blob/master/img/Pages.PNG?raw=true" alt="Pages" /><br />
<br />
Here you also have the option to select a theme. These themes are rather limiting though, so I opted for a theme with a little more substance.</p>

<h2 id="design-and-implementation">Design and Implementation</h2>

<p>GitHub Pages hosts static web pages, so if you want something a little more fancier, you will need to choose a different hosting provider.</p>

<p>There are quite a few platforms for generating static web pages.</p>

<p>The most popular platform is probably <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. However, it requires installing the Ruby programming language which I don&rsquo;t have that much interest in learning (Choose what interests you). To be fair, they do have a lot of resources and themes that are useful to newcomers.</p>

<p>Instead I chose <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> because it&rsquo;s written in a language I&rsquo;m intersted in learning, GO! They also have some pretty good resources and themes.</p>

<p>I wont go through installing <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> or <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">Hugo</a>, but I will go over some of the things I thought were not documented well.</p>

<p><strong>PS: Please do not confuse the face that I didn&rsquo;t want to install Ruby over GO becasue you have to learn those languages. That is just the language they are written in.</strong></p>

<h4 id="tip-number-1">Tip Number 1</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Unless specified in your theme&rsquo;s templates, all Posts are in draft form. Change this to false if you&rsquo;re planning to post immediately.</p>

<pre><code>---
title: &quot;First Post&quot;
date: 2019-10-31T14:28:26-05:00`
draft: true
---
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="tip-number-2">Tip Number 2</h4>

<ul>
<li><p>You only need to upload the contents of the <code>/Public</code> folder to GitHub</p>

<pre><code>/Public  is created once you run the Hugo command
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="tip-number-3">Tip Number 3</h4>

<ul>
<li>Most themes come with an <code>exampleSite</code> folder.  Use the <code>config.toml</code> file as a guide to configure your own.</li>
</ul>

<p>Push your files up to your GitHub Master repository and head over to <code>UserName.github.io</code></p>

<p>Your page should be live now on GitHub!!</p>

<h2 id="domain-name-system-dns">Domain Name System (DNS)</h2>

<p>DNS translates your new domain name into an IP address that your web browser understands.
Your hosting provider might be able to host your DNS for you for a fee.</p>

<p>For my DNS hosting, I went with <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare</a> because they offer a free plan.</p>

<p>I changed the <code>CNAME</code> to Name=<code>NewDomainName</code> Content=<code>UserName.github.io</code></p>

<p>Back over on GitHub, in &ldquo;settings&rdquo; &ndash;&gt; &ldquo;GitHub Pages&rdquo; I added my domain name to the &ldquo;Custom Domain&rdquo; field and clicked &ldquo;Save&rdquo;</p>

<p>This adds a new file to your GitHub repository called <code>CNAME</code></p>

<h4 id="the-key-now-patience-because-it-can-take-a-while-for-this-information-to-propagate">The key now patience because it can take a while for this information to propagate.</h4>

<p>Hopefully by now everything is working and you are now able to enter your domain name into the address bar and be redirected to your GitHub Page!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still learning, but I hope you found some value in this post!</p>
